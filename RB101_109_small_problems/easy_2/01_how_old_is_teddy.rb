# Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age.
# To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.

# Example Output
#Teddy is 69 years old!
# def how_old?
# puts "Teddy is #{rand(20..200)} years old!"
# end
#
# how_old?
#
# # or simply
age = rand(20..200)
puts "Teddy is #{age} years old!"
