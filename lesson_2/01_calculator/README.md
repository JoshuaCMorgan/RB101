Walk-through: Calculator
Build a command line calculator program that does the following:

asks for two numbers
asks for the type of operation to perform: add, subtract, multiply or divide
displays the result

Use the `Kernel.gets()` method to retrieve user input, and use `Kernel.puts()` method to display output. Remember that `Kernel.gets()` includes the newline, so you have to call `chomp()` to remove it: `Kernel.gets().chomp()`.
