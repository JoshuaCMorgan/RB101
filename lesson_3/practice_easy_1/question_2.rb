# Describe the difference between `!` and `?` in Ruby.
# And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

  #
  # 1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?
  # 2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`
  # 3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`
  # 4. put `?` before something
  # 5. put `?` after something
  # 6. put `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`

#
# * `!=` means "not equals"
# * `? :` is the ternary operator for if...else
# * `!!<some object>` is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent. (Try it in irb)
# * `!<some object>` is used to turn any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent, just like the above, but opposite.
